## Introduction

This repository was code for “Development and validation of a deep learning signature for predicting lymph node metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma: comparison with radiomics signature and clinical-semantic model ”

This Medical Deep Learning Framework is developed based on https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification 

To further match 3D medical image, we developed 3D Convolutional Neural Network and 3D data transformation




Supported neural networks：

- [x] ResNet (3D)
- [x] ResNeXt (3D)
- [x] SE-ResNet
- [x] SE-ResNeXt
- [x] RegNet
- [x] ShuffleNetV1
- [x] ShuffleNetV2
- [x] MobileNetV2
- [x] MobileNetV3
- [x] Swin-Transformer
